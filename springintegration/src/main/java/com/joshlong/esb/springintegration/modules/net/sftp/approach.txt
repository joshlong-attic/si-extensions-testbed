basically, i'm modeling this after the work in the FTP inbound and outbound adapters:

 - the inbound adapter will be two components: a synchronizer and a filemessagesource

  the synchronizer reads a remote directory and, for eah file in the remote directory, if the file is a directory and there is either no equivalent or a different equivalent, it copies it to a local directory that we configure.
  the synchornizer will write the files to a local directory that the user configures. then, the inbound adapter will have a regular File FileReadingMessageSource.
  it will be configured to track all files in the local directory that match our glob (which, as is done n the ftp adpapter, is basically all files that DONT have the '.incomplete' suffix at the end thats added while theyre being downloaded by the synchronizer).
  as each file is read itll be passed from our sftpfilesource as an event. so, basically, we cheat: periodically we dump and sync file systems and then use the file adapter to see new files locally.
